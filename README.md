# SSEATTransCore

**SSEATTransCore** is a lightweight internal translation bridge built exclusively for [SSEAT](https://github.com/Cutleast/SSE-Auto-Translator/tree/master). It acts as a dedicated middle-layer microservice that provides string translation services through a local HTTP interface, and is not intended for standalone use.
